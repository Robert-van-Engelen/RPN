# RPN

A collection of powerful RPN calculator programs based on the HP-15C for the
SHARP PC-G850(V)(S) and PC-1475.

The RPN programs are written in BASIC.  The programs can be easily extended to
add custom operations and user-defined functions.

- complex arithmetic with separate stack registers for real and imaginary parts
- 10 memory registers R0 to R9
- one and two variable statistical functions
- linear regression
- hyperbolic and trigonometric functions for complex values
- coordinate conversions to polar and rectangular
- combinatorial functions nPr, nCr and !
- gamma function
- GCD and LCM
- rational approximation of a decimal
